## Requirements

This sections describes prerequisite for building OpenJDK with MMTk.

### Before You Start

#### Software Dependencies

* git, make, jdk and the gcc toolchain
  * You can install them simply via `sudo apt install git build-essential default-jdk`.
* Rustup nightly toolchain
  * Please visit [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) for installation instructions.

#### Supported Hardware

MMTk/OpenJDK only supports `linux-x86_64`.

_Tested on a Ryzen 9 3900X Machine with 32GB RAM, running Ubuntu 18.04-amd64 (Linux kernel version 4.15.0-21-generic)._

### Getting Sources (for MMTk and VM)

First, clone this binding repo:

```console
$ git clone --recursive git@github.com:mmtk/mmtk-openjdk.git
```

The `mmtk-openjdk` binding repo is located under the `mmtk` folder, as a git-submodule of the OpenJDK repo.

The `mmtk-core` crate is a cargo dependency of the `mmtk-openjdk` binding repo.

The `openjdk` repo is at `./repos/openjdk`. And `./openjdk` contains mmtk's ThirdPartyHeap implementation files.

## Build

_**Note:** MMTk is only tested with the `server` build variant._

After cloned the OpenJDK repo, cd into the root directiory:

```console
$ cd mmtk-openjdk/repos/openjdk
```

Then select a `DEBUG_LEVEL`, can be one of `release`, `fastdebug`, `slowdebug` and `optimized`.

```console
$ # As an example, here we choose to build the release version
$ DEBUG_LEVEL=release
```

The differences between the four debug levels are:

| `$DEBUG_LEVEL` | Debug Info | Optimizations | Assertions | MMTk _Cargo-Build_ Profile |
| -------------- | ----------:| -------------:| ----------:| ------------------------:|
| `release`      |         ✘ |             ✔ |         ✘ |                  release |
| `optimized`    |         ✘ |             ✔ |         ✘ |                    debug |
| `fastdebug`    |         ✔ |             ✔ |         ✔ |                    debug |
| `slowdebug`    |         ✔ |             ✘ |         ✔ |                    debug |

If you are building for the first time, run the configure script:

```console
$ sh configure --disable-warnings-as-errors --with-debug-level=$DEBUG_LEVEL
```

Then build OpenJDK (this will build MMTk as well):

```console
$ make CONF=linux-x86_64-normal-server-$DEBUG_LEVEL THIRD_PARTY_HEAP=$PWD/../../openjdk
```

The output jdk is at `./build/linux-x86_64-normal-server-$DEBUG_LEVEL/jdk`.

## Test

### Run HelloWorld (without MMTk)

```console
$ cat ./HelloWorld.java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
$ ./build/linux-x86_64-normal-server-$DEBUG_LEVEL/jdk/bin/javac HelloWorld.java
$ ./build/linux-x86_64-normal-server-$DEBUG_LEVEL/jdk/bin/java HelloWorld
Hello World!
```

### Run DaCapo Benchmarks with MMTk (on a moma machine)

**Note:** Pass `-XX:+UseThirdPartyHeap` as java command line arguments to enable MMTk.

```console
$ ./build/linux-x86_64-normal-server-$DEBUG_LEVEL/jdk/bin/java -XX:+UseThirdPartyHeap -Xms512M -Xmx512M -jar /usr/share/benchmarks/dacapo/dacapo-9.12-bach.jar lusearch
